            - In this experiment you will be asked to identify English words, letter combinations, or environmental sounds. Sometimes you will just hear a word or sound, other times you will see a video of a person saying a word. Space to continue...
            - The items may be difficult to understand. An H at the beginning of the trial means the item will be harder to understand, an E means it will be easier. Listen carefully and try to figure out what you heard. Space to continue...
            - After you listen to the item, you will be given four choices. Use the 4 arrow keys to choose the answer that best matches what you heard. Space to continue...
            - For example, if what you heard matches the answer on the top of the screen, press the up arrow. Press space to start the experiment...
        rest instructions: You will now be given a 2 minute break.  The experiment will resume automatically.
